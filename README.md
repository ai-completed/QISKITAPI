# Qiskit API This repository houses an advanced API built atop Qiskit, the esteemed quantum computing framework. It is designed to streamline quantum computing tasks, offering an intuitive interface for constructing, visualizing, and running quantum circuits. ## Features - **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes both traditional and quantum-enhanced authentication mechanisms to secure access. - **Interactive Circuit Design**: Enables the creation of quantum circuits with ease, supporting parameterization for advanced applications. - **Diverse Execution Backends**: Offers the flexibility to execute circuits on various backends, including local simulators and remote quantum processors. - **Asynchronous Computation**: Facilitates long-running quantum computations with non-blocking operation support, essential for web interfaces and batch processing. - **Visual Feedback**: Incorporates visualization tools to render both circuits and computation outcomes, aiding in education and analysis. - **Error Mitigation Techniques**: Lays the foundation for implementing error correction protocols to counteract quantum noise effects. - **Quantum-Safe Security**: Integrates quantum-resistant cryptographic methods to safeguard sensitive information. ## Quick Start ### Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed: - Python 3.8+ - Qiskit 0.23.0+ - Flask 1.1.2+ (for running the web server) ### Installation To set up the Qiskit API on your local machine: 1. Clone the repository to your local machine: ```sh git clone [repository_url]
Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the necessary packages:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the API
Start the web server by executing:

sh
Copy code
python -m web_interface
For using the API in a Python script:

python
Copy code
from qiskit_api import create_quantum_circuit, run_quantum_circuit # Initialize a 5-qubit quantum circuit circuit = create_quantum_circuit(5) # Execute the circuit on a simulator results = run_quantum_circuit(circuit) print(results)
Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available in the docs/ directory, covering detailed API usage, endpoint descriptions, and examples.
